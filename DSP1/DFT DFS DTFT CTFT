https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsampling
upsampling: interpolation with zeros first in time domain, then filtering
downsampling: low pass filtering, then decimation in time domain,
brief: Upsampling requires a lowpass filter after increasing the data rate,
       and downsampling requires a lowpass filter before decimation. Therefore, 
       both operations can be accomplished by a single filter with the lower of the two cutoff frequencies.
       For the L > M case, the interpolation filter cutoff,  {\displaystyle {\tfrac {0.5}{L}}}{\tfrac  {0.5}{L}} cycles per intermediate sample, 
       is the lower frequency.
       
        in time domain resampling can be done, interploation with zeros-> low pass filtering-> demiciamtion


in spectrum, resampling can be done
   DFT first,  resampling in frequency domain(expansion spectrum array to wanted length and then assign target spectrum), then IFFT
   DFT source signal-> process it into target spectrum->IFFT
