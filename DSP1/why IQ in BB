ASK/PSK/MSK/FSK should be created by IQ modulation way, means complex signal data which from I channel and Q channel will be used to control the amplitude and phase of carrier signal(LO)
2
AM/FM/PM is created by modulating carrier signal with analog signal in typical sg, means there is internal arbitary signal generator which to control carrier signal amplitude/phase by 
3
hardware way.

4.  IQ generator way is done by mapping payload into complex data which already caculated,  final mapped complex data is waveform which is complex array

5. IQ modulation can be expressed by complex multiply 
   so for OFDM, baseband signal is crated by payload to carrier Constellation which has multi-carriers
   so OFDM signal is actually one mult-carrier signal which has many sub carriers!! general carrier concept is RF carrier, but from mathmatic point view,  there is 2 stages of carry-payload process. 
   one is payload to subcarrier, another is combined OFDM symboal to RF carrier 

6. once CT signal was sampled, then sampled signal after ADC can be processed with DSP way, in this stage, please forget relation between this digiatl signal with CT signal, 
   in DSP, frequency has different concept with CT signal, period always from [-pi,pi].
