ASK/PSK/MSK/FSK should be created by IQ modulation way, means complex signal data which from I channel and Q channel will be used to control the amplitude and phase of carrier signal(LO)
2
AM/FM/PM is created by modulating carrier signal with analog signal in typical sg, means there is internal arbitary signal generator which to control carrier signal amplitude/phase by 
3
hardware way.

4.  IQ generator way is done by mapping payload into complex data which already caculated,  final mapped complex data is waveform which is complex array

5. IQ modulation can be expressed by complex multiply 
   so for OFDM, baseband signal is crated by payload to carrier Constellation which
