1 .mat-card can not reponse focus, below css does not works

// .alloy-card:focus{
//     border-width: 2px;
//     border-color: red;
// }
2. to make it reponse focus with above code, 
<alloy-card cardTitle="Carriers" [tabIndex]="1"></alloy-card>
  then in low version angular,  border line color will change into one kinds of color
  in high version, background-color can be changed,
  
  so matcard is not nice to focus event.
  can be put on top of button, with button response to button
