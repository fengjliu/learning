1. backend will be C# console.exe which combine sgTransport component
2. VSA control will be done with C#
3. because AWU backend is console program, then no need for WCF API wrapper, a seprate launch.exe can be used to manage its application recycle.

1.SgTransport contain CommandServer, CommandServer utilize websocketCSharp server,  when message received by  websocketCSharp server, then its OnMessage() will be called, 
  then CommandServer will be raise event, because this event is subsribed by sgTransport, then received data will be dispatched 
            protected override void OnMessage(MessageEventArgs e)
            {

                if (e.IsText)
                {
                    this.CommandServer.OnMessageReceived(e.Data);
                }
                else if (e.IsBinary)
                {
                    this.CommandServer.OnDataReceived(e.RawData);
                }

            }


 here to get access of internal contained class, there is 2 ways, one is active way, one is inactive way, 
 active way inject upper level object to lower level object is created. (WebSocketServer->Command server)
 another way is to subscribe upper level object function to the event of lower level. (Command Server->SgTransport)

 dispatch function is used to call different process function depends on different CommandType from web.
 
2. in front end, the connnection is done by pluginService, which provide common way to establish connection and send message to backend. 
   depends on diffent port,  the plugin service maybe need override 
3. application contain top-most settings and playbackManager
   servce is injected by angular component,   when creating service , the application instance and all contained settings will be created.
