  To understand the capabilities of the Angular framework, you need to learn about the following

  # Components
  # Templates
  
      In Angular, a template is a blueprint for a fragment of a user interface (UI). Templates are written in HTML, and special syntax can be used within a template to build on many of Angular's features.
      can be seen as Enhancing HTML

      Angular extends the HTML syntax in your templates with additional functionality.For example, Angularâ€™s data binding syntax helps to set Document Object Model (DOM) properties dynamically.

      end
```
   (event)="statement"<br>
   Use template statements with elements, components, or directives in response to events<br>
   Responding to events is an aspect of Angular's unidirectional data flow. You can change anything in your application during a single event loop.<br>
```
<button type="button" (click)="deleteHero()">Delete hero</button>
```
  ## Syntax
  Like template expressions, template statements use a language that looks like JavaScript. However, the parser for template statements differs from the parser for template expressions. In addition, the template statements parser specifically supports both basic assignment (=) and chaining expressions with semicolons (;).

The following JavaScript and template expression syntax is not allowed:

.new<br>
.Increment and decrement operators, ++ and --<br>
.Operator assignment, such as += and -=<br>
.The bitwise operators, such as | and &<br>
.The pipe operator<br>
 ## Statement context
 Statements can refer only to what's in the statement context <br>
```
<button type="button" (click)="onSave($event)">Save</button>
<button type="button" *ngFor="let hero of heroes" (click)="deleteHero(hero)">{{hero.name}}</button>
<form #heroForm (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(heroForm)"> ... </form>
```
In this example, the context of the $event object, hero, and #heroForm is the template context names take precedence over component context names
  # Directives
  # Dependency injection
