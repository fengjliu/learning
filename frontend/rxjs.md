RxJS provides an implementation of the Observable type, which is needed until the type becomes part of the language and until browsers support it. The library also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables. These utility functions can be used for:

	Converting existing code for async operations into observables

	Iterating through the values in a stream

	Mapping values to different types

	Filtering streams

	Composing multiple streams
